NOTE: I plan to use /CalVer/ versioning scheme
* 2022.0.Î±
 ** finish to configure neorg
  -- [ ] I need something to add todos and basically make writing this faster
  -- [x] dirman
  -- [x] concealer
  -- [x] journal
  -- [x] gtd
  -- [?] org-export, y'now'whatimsayin? {}

 ** Python
  -- [x] Get python server to use `pylsp` -or `jedi`-, not `pyright` 
  -- [x] Get `sniprun` to use virtual environments (e.g. `conda main`)
         follow-up: just use `conda activate main` before launching `lvim`.

 ** LunarVim config
  -- [?] add alias:
           @code bash
             alias nvim="lvim"
           @end
  -- [ ] use neorg for a literate config
  -- [ ] set it into a git repo, stow it.
  -- [ ] modularize (the external plugins are starting to get out of hand)
  -- [ ] Use melange LIGHT
  --- [ ] Advanced: tweak the theme so no italic
  --- [ ] Same could be said of onedarker (no italics)
.
 ** More plugins:
  -- [ ] unicode.vim
  --- Could I revamp that into a Lua plugin with extra stuff like "parse as you type"?
  -- [ ] figure out how to surround things or install Vim surround

 ** Misc
  - [ ] Lua formatting or something
  - [_] Install GNVim or neovide
  - [ ] patch Iosevka SS04 for nerdicons or make nerd Iosevka to use SS04.
  -- I /think/ I can solve it using *kitty*.
